My name is Xiaoyun Li (黎 潇云). I'm a research scientist at Baidu Research Institute, developing algorithms and theory for big data and machine learning. Before joining Baidu, I received my Ph.D in statistics from Rutgers University.

Education
======
* B.S. in Financial Mathematics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, 2011-2015
* M.S. in Financial Statistics and Risk Management, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, USA, 2015-2017
* Ph.D in Statistics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, USA, 2017-2020\
  I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ping Li.\
  PhD thesis committee: Prof. Ping Li, Prof. Cun-Hui Zhang, Prof. Min Xu, Prof. William Steiger.

Work experience
======
* Teaching Assistant, Department of Statistics, Rutgers University\
   -- Courses: Introduction to Statistics, Advanced Simulation, Data Mining

* Baidu Research Institute

Interests
======
Statistics, Machine Learning, Randomized Algorithms, Search, Optimization, Deep Learning, Basketball, Guitar... and anything interesting!
